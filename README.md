### Hi there, Dewald here ðŸ‘‹

This is a collection of my personal repositories, some old some new.

My personal favourite currently is my [NixOS repository](https://github.com/DewaldV/nixos) that hosts all the config for my different machines.  I enjoy configuring multiple machines declaratively, having previously used [Babushka](https://babushka.me/) with my own [babushka-deps](https://github.com/DewaldV/babushka-deps) back in my Mac days.

I'm currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by building small games with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as a way to explore the language a bit more.
